# KartonSec Geocode Processor

KartonSec Geocode Processor is a high-performance geocoding tool built with the [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime. It efficiently processes geocoding tasks by reading addresses from a CSV file, sending them to a geocoding API, and writing the results back to an output CSV file. Leveraging Bun's speed and modern features, this tool is optimized for performance and developer experience.

## Features

- **Powered by Bun**: Built on the blazing-fast Bun runtime for superior performance.
- **CSV Input/Output**: Reads addresses from a CSV file and writes geocoded results to another CSV file.
- **Batch Processing**: Processes records in configurable batch sizes for efficiency.
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable delay between API requests to avoid hitting rate limits.
- **Customizable**: Easily configurable via a JSON configuration file.
- **Error Handling**: Handles errors gracefully and logs issues for debugging.

## Configuration

The tool uses a configuration file (`config/default.json`) to define its behavior. Below is an example configuration:

```json
{
  "inputCsvPath": "input/kartonsec-pov.csv",
  "baseOutputCsvPath": "output/kartonsec-output.csv",
  "addressColumnIndex": 9,
  "requestDelayMs": 200,
  "maxRecordsToProcess": 0,
  "batchWriteSize": 10,
  "fromRow": 0,
  "logsFolder": "logs"
}
```

### Configuration Options

- **`inputCsvPath`**: Path to the input CSV file containing addresses.
- **`baseOutputCsvPath`**: Path to the base output CSV file where results will be written.
- **`addressColumnIndex`**: The column index (0-based) in the input CSV that contains the address data.
- **`requestDelayMs`**: Delay (in milliseconds) between API requests to avoid rate limits.
- **`maxRecordsToProcess`**: Maximum number of records to process. Set to `0` to process all records.
- **`batchWriteSize`**: Number of records to write to the output file in each batch.
- **`fromRow`**: Number of record to start processing from.
- **`logsFolder`**: Directory where log files will be stored. Defaults to `"logs"`.

## Installation

## Why Bun?

Bun is a modern JavaScript runtime that offers several advantages over traditional runtimes like Node.js:
- **Speed**: Bun is designed to be fast, with a focus on performance.
- **Built-in Tools**: Includes a bundler, transpiler, and task runner out of the box.
- **Modern APIs**: Supports modern JavaScript and TypeScript features seamlessly.

By leveraging Bun, GS Geocode Processor ensures a faster and smoother experience for developers and users alike.

## Requirements
